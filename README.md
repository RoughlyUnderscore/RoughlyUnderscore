Hey! :wave: I am a software developer. Having started in **2016**, I have tried coding in:
* **Python** (moderate)
* **HTML** (moderate)
* **CSS/SASS** (moderate)
* **C#** (novice)
* **JavaScript** (novice)
* **Java** (experienced)
* **Kotlin** (knowledgeable)

I have worked with numerous popular libraries, frameworks and APIs, such as:
* **Pygame** (novice)
* **jQuery** (novice)
* **FXML** (moderate)
* **Android API** (amateur)
* **Spigot API** (experienced)

My notable works
===
Despite the fact that I've been a developer for 6 years, at most 3 of them have been taken seriously. As such, I do not have a huge portfolio, but there are some notable works of mine:
> - [UnderscoreEnchants](https://github.com/RoughlyUnderscore/UnderscoreEnchants) - as of 2022, my largest project so far. It is a Spigot plugin that allows for user-made enchantments! It's [open-sourced](https://github.com/RoughlyUnderscore/UnderscoreEnchantsCode) and has an [API](https://github.com/RoughlyUnderscore/UnderscoreEnchantsAPI), hosted at [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.zbll-cuber.enchantsapi/UnderscoreEnchantsAPI/2.0.10); [this](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%AD%90-underscoreenchants-%E2%AD%90-create-custom-enchantments-2-guis-%E2%9A%A1.97002/) is its Spigot page.
> - [My website](https://github.com/RoughlyUnderscore/ZBLLRoughlyWebsite) - it kinda looks like an abomination, but hey, it works!
> - I am currently working on a huge Minecraft network with my friends, where I am the lead developer and am currently in charge of developing a custom prison plugin.
> - I am also currently working on a library for general purpose & Spigot, which will be written fully in Kotlin.

What I do
===
I am currently a freelance developer, taking commissions on developing Spigot & Paper plugins and building Minecraft servers from scratch or extending existing ones. If you are interested, hit me up!

Contact me
===
You can easily contact me in three ways:
> - My Discord (Pluggg#5737) is easily the most effective way to contact me.
> - My mail (roughly.underscore (at) gmail.com) is also rather effective, but will probably take longer to be noticed.
> - My SpigotMC account (https://www.spigotmc.org/members/zbll.864229/) is the least effective one, but one day I definitely will notice you.
